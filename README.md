# ðŸŽˆ BART Study - AUC Scientific Thinking Project

Thank you for helping us with our Scientific Thinking group project at AUC!

## What is this?

This is a small game we developed for a class research project to explore how time pressure affects decision-making.
You'll be asked to pump virtual balloons to earn money â€” but if the balloon pops, you lose it all!
One round is under normal conditions, and the other with a time limit.

    The top performer wins a 600 EGP prize! ðŸŽ‰

## Is it safe?

Yes. This app does not access or modify anything on your computer.
It only records your responses and uploads them (anonymously) to our secure database (Supabase).

    âœ… Open source: You can view the exact code we used in this repo.

    âœ… Clean: You can test the .py file yourself or run the app in a controlled environment like a library PC.

    âœ… Transparent: No personal or identifying data is collected unless you voluntarily enter your contact info for the prize.

## How to run

    Windows: Run the BART.exe file.

    Please make sure you are in a quiet place, and avoid distractions during the task.
