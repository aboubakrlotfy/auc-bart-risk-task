# ðŸŽˆ Time Pressure and Risk-Taking: A BART-Based Experiment

This repository contains the materials, executable, raw data, and analysis code for a psychology experiment conducted at the American University in Cairo (AUC). The experiment investigates how **time pressure affects risk-taking in decision-making** using the **Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART)**.

## Experiment Summary

Participants completed two versions of the BART, with randomly assigned order per gender. There was a 5 min break between conditions:
- **Baseline Condition** â€” No time pressure  
- **Time-Pressure Condition** â€” 15-second limit per round  

The **risk-adjusted score** was used to quantify risk-taking, calculated as the average number of pumps on balloons that did not explode.

## Key Outputs

All statistical analyses and visualizations are located in the `/data_analysis/` folder. These include:

- Descriptive statistics and **paired t-test**
- Regression models testing **moderating variables**:
  - Gender  
  - Academic standing  
  - Caffeine intake  
  - Stress level  
  - Sleep  
  - Submission time  
- **Appendix A** (`appendix_a_cleaned_data.csv`) contains cleaned, participant-level results for transparency and reference.
